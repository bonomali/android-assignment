Android Assignment
==================

Hello and welcome to this assignment!

We have probably told you in the face-to-face interview, but just be perfect clear: we don't want you to spend too much time on this. You can do a great work spending 4 hours-ish, so no need to spend days on this. Please work as in a real project, commit and push your code along the day. If you have any questions, drop an email to josemando@colab.re or open an issue ;)

## Description
We love cities, they are awesome \o/. So we want a simple app where we can see pictures of our cities.

## As a user I want to...
* Fetch images from Instagram that meet the following criteria:
  * Tagged with the name of the city I'm currently on.
  * Were posted no far than 20km from where I am.
* See the images in a list as a thumbnail with the poster name.
* Select a image and present in a new view. This view should contain the larger image, and all the data you have about it.
* Sort the list by either date, number of likes or distance from me.

## Requirements
* Use Gradle, I've heard that's good.
* Use Retrofit, it's good and makes network requests easier.
* Save all post clicks in an array.
* Thumbnails in master view should be grayscale. Colored in detail view.
* Persist posts so I can look at them when I'm offline.
* Responsive table view.

## Optional
* Work a little on the design. Don't put too much effort into this, but you are free to wow us :).
* Impress us ;)
